# Foxtrot Domain Knowledge

Reference guidance for finance and shopping-execution workflows.

## Lunch Money

The `lunch_money` tool wraps the Lunch Money API.

1. **Always fetch categories first.** When the user asks about spending by
   category (e.g., "How much did I spend on Groceries?"), call
   `GET /categories` to look up the `category_id` before querying transactions.
   `category_name` is NOT a valid transaction filter — using it returns all
   transactions unfiltered.

2. **Filter by `category_id`, never `category_name`.** The transactions
   endpoint accepts `category_id` (integer) but silently ignores
   `category_name`. Always resolve the name to an ID first.

3. **Charged means budgetable — do not wait for transactions to clear the
   card.** Once a transaction is charged (even `is_pending: true`), categorize,
   note, and mark it `cleared` in the review workflow. There is nothing special
   about the credit-card clearing step; waiting on it only causes confusion and
   leaves work undone. The only exception is when the final posted amount is
   expected to differ from the pending hold (e.g., a tip/hold discrepancy) — in
   that case note the expected final amount and reconcile after it posts, but
   still categorize it now.

## Shopping

- Foxtrot owns purchase execution and purchase lifecycle work: Walmart queue
  review, Walmart cart changes, retailer order flows, order-status lookups,
  purchase records, receipts, reimbursements, and budget impact.
- Sierra may research and recommend products, but once the user asks to add,
  buy, order, remove from cart, check an order, or connect the purchase to
  finance records, Foxtrot owns the task.
- Queue management, purchase history, and browser-driven shopping are separate
  concerns. Use the right tool for each.
- **Never use `mcp__walmart__walmart queue_add` as a completion step when the
  user has asked you to add something to their Walmart cart.** `queue_add`
  writes to a local Tango list, not walmart.com. It is only useful for drafting
  or staging a list before the user reviews it.
- To add items to the user's actual Walmart cart, use `mcp__browser__browser`
  to navigate walmart.com and add items directly.
- Only report "done" on a cart add after verifying the item appears in the live
  cart via browser. If the browser add fails, report the failure honestly rather
  than falling back to the queue silently.
- Authenticated shopping flows depend on the user's configured browser profile
  and secret management setup.
- Avoid running multiple browser-heavy shopping flows at the same time unless
  the tasks are clearly independent and safe to run side by side.
- **Chipotle orders: before starting, read `agents/skills/chipotle-ordering.md`
  via `agent_docs`** — it carries verified turn-saving eval recipes (bag count,
  drawer open/remove, empty-confirm) and site hazards (the header bag icon can
  navigate to checkout, where a live Submit Order button sits next to the saved
  card; element refs go stale after drawer changes — re-snapshot, don't retry).
  A clean add-to-bag roundtrip is ~25-45 tool calls; bake-off verified
  (2026-06-10) that minimax-m2.5 and deepseek-v4-pro both complete it reliably
  with these recipes.

## Receipts

- Receipt files live at `Records/Finance/Receipts/{Retailer}/` in Obsidian
- Use the receipt_logging skill format for file structure
- For reimbursable receipts, add a ## Reimbursement Tracking section using receipt_registry
- Before saying no receipt exists or asking Devin for itemized split amounts,
  run `receipt_registry lookup_receipts` with the Lunch Money transaction ID
  when available, otherwise amount/date/merchant/store/item clues. If the
  receipt has item rows, use those rows for the split.
- When `lookup_receipts` matches a Lunch Money transaction, use its
  `lunchMoneyNote` value for the Lunch Money transaction or split note. The
  note must show purchased items or summary first and keep the Obsidian receipt
  link as the final line.
- Do not leave receipt-backed Lunch Money notes as only `Receipt`, only a URL,
  or an unexplained category label such as `Devin Spending`. If the category is
  truly Devin Spending, include the item details and evidence basis; if it is
  ambiguous, leave it for review instead of guessing.
- When an itemized receipt has subtotal and tax fields, sum the relevant item
  rows by Devin's category decision and allocate tax proportionally so the split
  totals match the Lunch Money transaction. Only ask for amounts if the receipt
  lacks item rows or the category ownership is still ambiguous.

## Categorization Rules

- Read categorization rules from `~/Documents/main/References/Finance/Lunch Money Rules.md`
- Apply rules to transactions, handle splits, flag ambiguous vendors for review
- Rate limit: wait 0.3s between Lunch Money API calls

## Domain Job Logs

All scheduled job output is logged to `Records/Jobs/Finance/YYYY-MM.md` in Obsidian.
The daily brief aggregator reads this file — ensure entries include a **Flagged:** section
for anything that needs user attention.

## Finance Current Status

When Devin asks what is left from a finance review, treat review notes and job
logs as historical candidate lists. Before answering, verify current state with
Lunch Money plus `receipt_registry`/Ramp as applicable. If a note is stale,
update the current review record with a timestamped correction before reporting
the current open items. For Lunch Money review-inbox queries, use
`status=uncleared`; do not use `status=unreviewed`.

## Self-Update

When the user gives behavioral feedback, update this knowledge file using the
`mcp__agent-docs__agent_docs` tool (patch for surgical edits, write for larger rewrites).

## Kilo Ledger

Kilo is the kid-facing spending agent. Kilo owns the kid-facing bucket
experience; Foxtrot owns weekly review of the profile-configured Lunch Money
spending category that maps to Kilo.

Use the private Obsidian Kilo spending runbook as the human operating
procedure. During weekly Finance Review, review configured Kilo spending
transactions, read `kilo_ledger summary`, recommend the best matching active
discretionary Kilo bucket for each current transaction, wait for owner approval
or adjustment, then call `kilo_ledger` with
`record_spend` to debit that Kilo bucket internally.

Use `record_historical_spend` only for old/context purchases that should appear
in Kilo history without changing current balances.

This is ledger-only bookkeeping. It is not a bank transfer. Bank transfers
remain manual unless a profile-specific automation says otherwise. After the later bank/Lunch Money transfer posts, use
`settle_spending` to mark the already-recorded Kilo spends as externally
settled; settlements do not debit buckets again.

Bucket matching examples:

- Food purchases -> active food-like bucket
- Clothes -> active clothing-like bucket
- Games, media, apps, subscriptions, LEGO, toys -> active fun/activity-like bucket
- Activities, outings, fun fallback -> active fun/activity-like bucket
- Gifts for other people -> active gifts-like bucket

These examples are not fixed bucket ids. The active bucket list in the Kilo
ledger is authoritative. Do not assume an `entertainment` bucket exists just
because older history references one; only use it if `kilo_ledger summary`
returns it as active. Do not debit Tithing or Savings for spending.

Monthly funding is owner/background-owned, not kid-facing. Verify the real
profile-configured funding transfer after it is due; if it has posted and is
not already ledgered, apply the configured Kilo monthly funding split. If
approved spending has been ledgered but not yet swept out of the backing
account, expected external balance is ledger total plus pending settlement. If
the Kilo ledger drifts from that expected bank/Lunch Money balance, warn the
owner but do not block allowed ledger writes.
