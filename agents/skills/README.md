# Agent Skills

Shared workflow guidance for Tango agents.

See [`docs/guides/agents-structure.md`](../../docs/guides/agents-structure.md) for placement rules and the skill-creation checklist.

Purpose:
- capture reusable "how to do this well" knowledge
- avoid overloading assistant `knowledge.md` files with cross-domain guidance
- keep assistant `soul.md` files focused on identity, behavior, and output rules

Reference these docs deliberately from agent prompts when a V2 agent needs the workflow guidance.

- Keep them short enough to reference deliberately from an agent prompt.
- Put assistant-specific facts in `agents/assistants/<id>/knowledge.md`, not here.
