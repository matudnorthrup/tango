# attachment_search, attachment_read, attachment_status, attachment_reprocess, attachment_update, attachment_enumerate

Use these tools when a user asks about images, screenshots, PDFs, CSVs, markdown files, or other documents they have uploaded to Tango.

Agents may also receive a `Relevant attachment directories` context block. That block is a compact index only: use it to identify likely attachments and source refs, then call these tools when the user needs exact text, quotes, tables, or more detail.

Default behavior:
- Do not ask the user to resend an upload until `attachment_search`/`attachment_status` cannot find it or it is not processed yet.
- Prefer compact summaries, snippets, chunks, and tables over full extracted text.
- Cite returned source refs for exact claims and quotes.
- Do not expose absolute local source-file paths.

## `attachment_search`

Find processed attachments without loading full extracted text.

Use it when:
- The user refers to an uploaded file without giving an exact attachment id.
- You need to find prior images/documents by topic, filename, type, project, channel, or session.
- You need a compact list of summaries, snippets, statuses, and source refs.
- Directory context mentions a likely attachment but you need to confirm its current status or locate related attachments.

Important parameters:
- `query`: optional search text. Empty query returns recent matching attachments.
- `types`: optional filters such as `image`, `ocr_text`, `text/markdown`, `pdf`.
- `project_id`, `agent_id`, `session_id`, `channel_id`, `thread_id`, `user_id`: optional scope filters.
- `limit`: default 8, max 25.

## `attachment_read`

Read a bounded part of one attachment.

Use it when:
- `attachment_search` found a likely match and you need a summary, snippets, chunks, tables, or exact extracted text.
- The user asks for a quote or specific detail from a known attachment.
- You need source refs for a claim.
- Directory context contains `available_reads` and you need one of those bounded views.

Modes:
- `summary`: default compact view.
- `directory`: full compact directory payload.
- `snippets` or `quotes`: source-linked key text.
- `chunks`: bounded chunks, optionally filtered by `query`.
- `chunk`: one chunk by `chunk_id` or `chunk_ordinal`.
- `tables`: detected table previews.
- `visual_notes`: OCR/image processing notes.
- `source_file`: source metadata and refs without exposing absolute file paths.
- `extracted_text`: bounded extracted text. Use `offset` and `max_chars`; default max is 4000, hard max is 12000.

Do not request `extracted_text` first for large documents. Start with `summary`, `snippets`, or `chunks`.

For exact quotes, prefer `snippets`, `quotes`, `chunk`, or filtered `chunks` and include the returned text/source ref in the answer. For long documents, use `offset` and `max_chars` instead of asking for all extracted text.

## `attachment_status`

Check processing state.

Use it when:
- The user asks whether an upload is ready.
- An attachment search/read does not find expected data.
- You need to distinguish pending, partial, failed, and ready attachments.

Status guidance:
- `ready`: directory and retrieval views should be usable.
- `partial`: some text/directory data may exist; answer with caveats and retrieve the available bounded views.
- `processing`, `received`, or pending jobs: tell the user it is still processing and check again later only if a follow-up mechanism is available.
- `failed`: say processing failed and use any returned error/status details. Do not invent OCR or missing text.
- `retired`: source or derived data may no longer be available under retention rules.

## `attachment_reprocess`

This write/admin tool is intentionally not in the default agent allowlists. Use only when explicitly enabled and the user/admin wants to retry or upgrade processing.

Batch form: `ids` - optional array of attachment ids or `attachment:<id>` refs (max 25 raw entries), a batch alternative to `id`/`attachment_id`. The same `strategy`, `reason`, and `context_hint` apply to every id in the batch. An array longer than 25 is refused before any id is processed, naming the raw submitted length, not the deduped count: `attachment_reprocess accepts at most 25 ids per call (received N)`.

Optional `context_hint`: operator context (a venue name, project name, or correction) fed into the directory builder's summary AND tags when `strategy=directory`. Max 500 characters; over the cap the call is refused rather than silently truncated, with this exact message: `attachment_reprocess context_hint must be 500 characters or fewer (received N)` (N is the trimmed hint's length). A hint is recorded verbatim in the resulting directory payload as `context_hint`, alongside `hint_guided: true`, so a human-guided description stays permanently distinguishable from unguided machine output. `context_hint` only takes effect on `strategy=directory` runs; other strategies accept the field without erroring but do not thread it forward. Absent or blank `context_hint` produces output byte-identical to before this field existed.

## `attachment_update`

Edits `attachments.title` and `attachments.project_id` only (v0: real columns, no schema change). This write/admin tool is intentionally not in the default agent allowlists.

As shipped in the T-I-125 phase-1 build, this tool is also UNGRANTED in the governance catalog: the migration that registers its tool id inserts no permission rows, so it is not usable by any agent or worker until an operator applies a prepared grant script by hand. Seeing the tool id in a catalog/manual is not the same as being permitted to call it. Current grant status for this tool id is visible via `governance_permitted_tools` with `tool_id: "attachment_update"`; `exists-but-not-granted` means "not armed yet," not "does not exist."

Fields:
- `id` or `attachment_id`: the attachment to update.
- `ids`: optional array of attachment ids/`attachment:<id>` refs (max 25 raw entries), a batch alternative to `id`/`attachment_id`. The same `title`/`project` apply to every id. Over-cap is refused before any id is processed, naming the raw submitted length: `attachment_update accepts at most 25 ids per call (received N)`.
- `title`: optional new title.
- `project`: optional new project id.

At least one of `title`/`project` is required. A call with neither is refused, never treated as a silent no-op: `attachment_update requires title and/or project`.

Any field outside `id`, `attachment_id`, `ids`, `title`, `project` is refused, never silently dropped, with this exact message: `attachment_update v0 edits title and project only; description/tags/roles are gated on the upstream design conversation (T-I-125)`. Description, tags, and lifecycle role edits are not available in phase 1; they wait on that upstream design conversation. Description and tags remain machine-generated in phase 1; `attachment_reprocess`'s `context_hint` (documented above) influences what the machine writes.

## `attachment_enumerate`

Exhaustive listing over the attachment library (Folio), the sibling to `attachment_search`: completeness-first, unlike `attachment_search`'s relevance ranking, returning the full matching set (e.g. every PDF, every image tagged a given label) with an exact total.

Read-only, but as shipped in the T-I-125 phase-1 build it is UNGRANTED in the governance catalog for the same reason as `attachment_update` above: the migration registers the tool id, no permission rows are inserted, and it is not usable until an operator applies a prepared grant script. Grant status is visible via `governance_permitted_tools`; read-only does not mean pre-armed.

Fields:
- `mode`: required - `list_projects`, `list_tags`, or `by_label`.
- `list_projects`: returns every distinct `project_id` with its attachment count. No other fields needed.
- `list_tags`: returns every distinct tag, matched case-insensitively, with its count, drawn from each attachment's LATEST directory row only (earlier directory versions are not counted). Optional `project_id` narrows to one project.
- `by_label`: returns every attachment matching `tag` and/or `project_id` (`attachment_id`, `title`, `content_type`, `created_at`), with an exact `total` count that holds across pages, plus the current page's `items`. Fields: `tag` (case-insensitive exact match against the latest directory row's tags, not a substring match), `project_id`, `limit` (default 50, max 200), `offset` (default 0). At least one of `tag`/`project_id` is required - a call with neither is refused: `attachment_enumerate mode=by_label requires tag and/or project_id`.

Calling without `mode`, or with an unrecognized `mode`, is refused: `attachment_enumerate requires mode: list_projects, list_tags, or by_label`.

Empty results are honest: an unmatched tag or project returns `total: 0` and an empty list, never an error.
