# Docs

This directory contains durable project knowledge. Active project tracking,
status updates, validation evidence, and approval gates belong in Linear, not in
repo markdown.

Current structure:

- `guides/`: stable operator, contributor, and agent process documentation
- `specs/`: implementation-facing product specs
- `architecture/`: architecture decisions and current architecture references
- `retros/`: postmortems, cleanup records, and durable lessons learned
- `projects/`: legacy project writeups; do not add mutable project
  status here when Linear can hold the source of truth

Retention policy:

- Keep architecture decisions, retros/postmortems, operator guides, specs, and
  safe prompt/runtime asset docs in the repo.
- Move active project plans, mutable status updates, validation evidence, open
  questions, approval gates, and work breakdowns into Linear.
- Move private user context, raw personal analysis, machine-local artifacts, and
  profile-specific prompt/config overlays outside the repo.
