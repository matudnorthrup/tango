# Chief of Staff / PM Agent Architecture

## Overview

Tango development uses a three-tier agent hierarchy:

```
Devin (Stakeholder)
  ↓  high-level direction, reviews specs, approves scope changes
Chief of Staff (CoS) — main Claude Code session
  ↓  project briefs, monitoring, iteration on PM process
PM Agent — Claude Code instance in tmux
  ↓  implements directly; optional work orders for parallel workstreams
Dev Agent (optional) — subagent or worktree-slot instance for parallel/oversized work
```

**Why this structure exists:** An agent heads-down in execution can lose process discipline — skipping Linear tracking, forgetting validation, going silent. The CoS observation layer detects and corrects those failures without requiring stakeholder intervention.

**2026-06-09 update:** the mandatory PM/dev split is retired. It existed because earlier models lost process discipline when they both managed and implemented, so all coding was delegated to Codex dev agents. Current models hold the combined role, so the PM implements directly and spawns dev agents only for genuine parallelism or context relief. The CoS layer remains as the process-discipline guard.

## Roles

### Stakeholder (Devin)
- Gives high-level direction ("build X", "fix Y", "harden Z")
- Reviews specs and major scope decisions
- Checks in 1–2x per day
- Expects completed work with documented results, not in-progress status
- Can interact directly with any PM agent via tmux if needed

### Chief of Staff (CoS)
This is the main Claude Code session. Responsibilities:

- **Receives work from Devin** and decomposes into project briefs
- **Spawns PM agents** in tmux with the PM role prompt loaded
- **Monitors PM compliance** — are they following the process? (Linear, delegation, monitoring, testing)
- **Surfaces specs and results** to Devin for review
- **Iterates on the PM prompt** when process failures are observed
- **Manages multiple PM agents** running in parallel on different projects

The CoS does NOT:
- Write project-scale implementation code (small direct fixes are fine; project work goes to a PM)
- Manage dev agents directly (that's the PM's job)
- Make scope decisions without Devin's input on non-trivial changes

### PM Agent
A Claude Code instance running in a tmux session. Follows the process in `docs/guides/pm-role-prompt.md`.

- **Owns one project** end-to-end
- **Creates Linear project and issues**
- **Implements directly**; spawns and manages dev agents in worktree slots when parallelism or context pressure warrants
- **Runs live testing** and documents results
- **Reports** via status file and Linear updates

### Dev Agent (optional)
Claude Code (or Codex, as a second opinion) in a worktree slot, spawned only when work benefits from parallel execution or context isolation. Receives work orders from the PM.

- **Writes code** in an isolated worktree
- **Runs tests** as specified in the work order
- **Reports completion** — the PM monitors via tmux

## Launching a PM Agent

### Tmux naming
```
TANGO-PM-{project-slug}
```
Example: `TANGO-PM-ramp-hardening`

### Launch command
```bash
# Create tmux session
tmux new-session -d -s TANGO-PM-{slug} -c "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"

# Launch Claude Code with PM role appended to default system prompt
tmux send-keys -t TANGO-PM-{slug} \
  'claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --append-system-prompt "$(cat docs/guides/pm-role-prompt.md)"' C-m
```

Key flags:
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions` — PM needs to run tools without approval prompts
- `--append-system-prompt` — adds PM role ON TOP of Claude Code's default system prompt (preserves tool instructions, MCP access, etc.)
- The PM prompt file is read at launch time via command substitution

### Passing the project brief
Write the brief to a temp file, then send it to the PM:
```bash
# Write brief
cat > /tmp/pm-brief-{slug}.md << 'EOF'
# Project Brief: {Name}
...
EOF

# Send to PM agent
tmux send-keys -t TANGO-PM-{slug} "$(cat /tmp/pm-brief-{slug}.md)" C-m
```

### PM lifecycle
1. **Spin up** when a new project is ready to start
2. **Run** until the project ships or is explicitly paused
3. **Tear down** after ship: release worktree slots, delete crons, update docs
4. The CoS tears down the tmux session after confirming ship

### PM reporting

**Retired 2026-06-10:** PMs no longer send reports to the `CHIEF-OF-STAFF` tmux
session — do not message that session. Linear is the reporting channel: PMs post
Project Updates after discovery/spec, on scope changes, when blocked, and at
ship (see `pm-role-prompt.md`). Whoever is monitoring (CoS or stakeholder) reads
Linear and the PM's tmux pane directly rather than waiting for pushed reports.

## CoS Monitoring Protocol

### When to check
After spawning a PM agent, the CoS creates a CronCreate monitoring job:
- New PM agents: check every 15–20 minutes for the first hour
- Established PMs (past first milestone): check every 30 minutes
- **Keep the monitoring cron running until the PM's Linear project reaches Ship** — don't delete it early
- Self-delete the cron only after confirming the final Linear Project Update is posted and the PM has cleaned up

### What to check

Each monitoring cycle, the CoS evaluates:

**1. Is the PM alive and working?**
```bash
tmux capture-pane -t TANGO-PM-{slug} -p -S -30
```

**2. Is Linear up to date?**
- Does a Linear project exist for this work?
- Are issues created with acceptance criteria?
- Do issue statuses reflect reality?

**3. Is execution healthy?**
- Are commits landing on the project branch?
- If work was delegated: are worktree slots active (`scripts/dev/list.sh`), and are monitoring crons running for those dev agents?

**4. Is testing happening?**
- Has the PM claimed the bot for live testing?
- Are test results documented in Linear issues?
- Is the PM trying to ship without live testing?

**5. Is the PM following directions?**
- Does the PM's work match the project brief?
- Is the PM inventing extra steps or scope?
- Is the PM asking the CoS for permission on standard ops?

### Intervention

When the CoS detects a process failure:
1. **Mild:** Send a correction via tmux (e.g., "You need to create a Linear project before continuing")
2. **Moderate:** Update the PM role prompt to prevent recurrence, restart the PM with the updated prompt
3. **Severe:** Tear down the PM, report the failure to Devin, iterate on the PM prompt before respawning

### Compliance log

The CoS maintains a running log of PM compliance observations in its status reporting to Devin. This informs prompt iteration.

## Status Files

### PM status file
Location: `/tmp/tango-pm-{project-slug}-status.md`
Updated by: PM agent
Read by: CoS monitoring checks

### CoS status file
Location: `/tmp/tango-cos-status.md`
Updated by: CoS
Read by: Devin (on request)

Contains:
- Active PM agents and their projects
- Compliance observations
- Prompt iteration log
- Escalation items for Devin

## Iteration

The primary value of this architecture is the ability to iterate on the PM prompt based on observed behavior. The CoS should:

1. **Log every process failure** observed during monitoring
2. **Categorize failures** (missed step? wrong judgment? context loss? tool misuse?)
3. **Update `docs/guides/pm-role-prompt.md`** to address the failure
4. **Test the updated prompt** on the next PM instance
5. **Track what works** — if a prompt change reduces a failure mode, note it

Over time, the PM role prompt should converge on reliable autonomous execution.
